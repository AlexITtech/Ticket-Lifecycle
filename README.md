"Agents monitor live tickets through the Agent Panel. Queue managers assign high-priority tickets to the appropriate agent(s) and ensure that the correct Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are enforced."

"In this example, the ticket priority is marked as Emergency because of its potential to significantly impact a critical business function. The SLA plan has been updated to reflect this urgency, and the ticket has been assigned to a senior technician. It's worth noting that in some ticketing systems, customers have the ability to define their own SLA plans."

"The assigned agent investigates and addresses the issue, ensuring consistent communication with the user throughout the process. In this example, the agent determined that the root cause was related to personal network issues on the user's end. The ticket status was updated to Resolved, and an internal note was added to inform all involved agents that the customer had expressed dissatisfaction. The internal message emphasized the importance of handling the situation with both empathy and urgency during any follow-up communication. Once the issue was confirmed as resolved, the ticket was officially closed."
